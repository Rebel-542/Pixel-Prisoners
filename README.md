Guardian Angel App is designed to provide an extra layer of protection for women in emergency situations. With real-time location tracking, the app allows users to share their whereabouts with trusted contacts instantly.
 In today’s world, personal security is a top priority, and this app serves as a proactive tool that can make all the difference when help is needed. With a sleek and easy-to-navigate interface, the app empowers women to stay connected with their trusted contacts and have peace of mind, knowing that help is just a tap away.

The Real-Time Location Sharing feature ensures that users can instantly share their live location with pre-selected contacts, providing transparency and enabling their loved ones to track their movements if necessary. Whether walking home late at night, traveling to an unfamiliar area, or in a potentially risky situation, the app ensures that users’ whereabouts are always accessible to those they trust the most.

A standout feature of the app is its Emergency Call Button. In critical situations, this button immediately places a call to either a trusted contact or local emergency services, depending on the user's settings. The call feature is designed to be simple to use, allowing users to quickly send an alert for help, even when they’re unable to speak.

Furthermore, the app’s background service capabilities ensure that users can continue to track and share their location even when the app is not actively in use, making it a reliable companion no matter what else you’re doing. Additionally, the app places a strong emphasis on user privacy and security, ensuring that only trusted contacts can access location data and emergency alerts.
